  		<p>Following approvals by faculty, Dean, and Chancellor’s Office, the Office of Institutional Research and Academic Planning coordinates the institution-level and state approval process.</p>
  		
  		<p>The institution-level and state approval process involves use of an external consultant, Board of Governors approval, distribution of Program Announcement to other New Jersey institutions of higher education, review and recommendation by the Academic Issues Committee of the New Jersey Presidents’ Council, and action by the New Jersey Presidents’ Council.</p>
  		
  		<p>The Office of Institutional Research and Academic Planning closely coordinates with the appropriate office responsible for the proposal, especially during the external consultant steps and revisions to the Program Announcement. </p>
