			<h3 style="color:#00684e">What is the basic process to establish a new degree program?</h3>
			<p>Following approvals by faculty, Dean, and Chancellor’s Office, the Office of Institutional Research and Academic Planning coordinates the institution-level and state approval process.</p>
			<p>The institution-level and state approval process involves use of an external consultant, Board of Governors approval, distribution of Program Announcement to other New Jersey institutions of higher education, review and recommendation by the Academic Issues Committee of the New Jersey Presidents’ Council, and action by the New Jersey Presidents’ Council. </p>
			<p>The Office of Institutional Research and Academic Planning closely coordinates with the appropriate office responsible for the proposal, especially during the external consultant steps and revisions to the Program Announcement.</p>

			<h3 style="color:#00684e">What are the two basic categories of certificates for academic credit at Rutgers?</h3>
			<p>Internal certificates are designed for students already admitted to and enrolled in a degree program.  The certificate’s credits are earned toward the degree program, and the certificate is granted to those in the degree program.  Certificates of this restricted type within degree programs may be established at the school and Chancellor level without additional process required (though the University Registrar should be notified when these internal certificates are established).  However, if certificates within degree programs allow enrollment of both students enrolled in a degree program and students not enrolled in a degree program, then the approval process for stand-alone certificates applies.</p>
			<p>Stand-alone certificates may be earned and awarded outside of a degree program.</p>

		<div class="certificateprogram" id="certificateprogram">
			<h3 style="color:#00684e">What is the basic process to establish a stand-alone certificate program?</h3>
			<p>Following approvals by faculty, Dean, and Chancellor’s Office, the Office of Institutional Research and Academic Planning coordinates the institution-level and state approval process.  A stand-alone certificate program goes as an information item to the Board of Governors and to the state.</p>
			<p>A brief proposal should cover the following:  title and purpose of the certificate program; need/demand; admission requirements; curriculum; required credits; learning outcomes; relationship if any to a degree program; mode of delivery (classroom instruction / hybrid / distance education); location(s) to be offered; and resource issues.</p>
			<p>If students enrolled in the stand-alone certificate program are to be eligible for federal financial aid, then federal Gainful Employment requirements must be met, including placement reporting.</p>
