      <h2 style="font-weight:bold">Disclosures: Credit Hour Policy</h2>
      <p>Rutgers University has <a href="http://policies.rutgers.edu/">policies</a> approved by its <a href="http://governingboards.rutgers.edu/">Board of Governors </a>that speak to the issue of credit hour assignment. These include the preamble to the <a href="http://policies.rutgers.edu/sites/policies/files/10.2.1-current.pdf">Academic Regulations Controlling the Educational Divisions of the University</a> and the <a href="http://policies.rutgers.edu/sites/policies/files/10.2.4%20-%20current.pdf">Units of Credit </a>policies. The latter defines course credit as the "academic currency" of the university that is to be used by all schools and colleges.  It delegates the authority for determining course credit by the "college, school, or Faculty authorizing the course."</p>
      <p>Related university policies that guide the use of credit assignment include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://policies.rutgers.edu/sites/policies/files/10.2.5%20-%20current.pdf">Student Scholastic Standing and Graduation </a></li>
          <li><a href="http://policies.rutgers.edu/sites/policies/files/10.2.7%20-%20current.pdf">Course Attendance</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://policies.rutgers.edu/sites/policies/files/10.2.8-current.pdf">Maximum and Minimum Loads</a></li>
        </ul>
      <p>The determination of course credit within each school or college of the university is informed by <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/highereducation/documents/pdf/Licensure/LicensureRules.pdf">New Jersey Administrative Code Title 9A </a>(see Sub-Chapter 1:9A:1-1.2 and Sub-Chapter 2: 9A:1-2.1 a -e).</p>
      <p>Credit hour decisions for online and hybrid courses and other alternative format courses are also governed by the tenured and tenure-track full-time faculty within the colleges and schools of the university, in conformity with standard accepted practice in higher education. Each school has its own procedures for how this is accomplished, depending upon size of school and the concomitant faculty, as well as tradition. In some instances, for example, within the largest academic unit at Rutgers, the School of Arts and Sciences, online and hybrid courses proceed through a formal faculty process that begins by review and recommendation from a curriculum committee and then a faculty vote on course approval. At the Graduate School-New Brunswick, these courses and complete degree programs are vetted by a faculty committee and then approved by the graduate faculty.</p>
      <p>Policies in the Rutgers University Policy Library are maintained and regularly updated/amended according to Rutgers Policy: <a href="http://policies.rutgers.edu/sites/policies/files/50.1.13%20-%20current.pdf">Formulation and Issuance of University Policies.</a></p>
      <p>The faculties at Rutgers have primacy in setting the policies and procedures of credit hours for their respective schools and units. Through each schoolâ€™s faculty, Rutgers has a clear and sustainable process for creating courses and deciding how many credits they will carry. Each school has its own set of <u><strong>bylaws</strong></u> that grant power to standing faculty entities, usually a faculty curriculum committee, which includes an ongoing process of review and assessment of assigned credit hours. Illustrative examples of this activity within the colleges and schools of the university include the <a href="http://sas.rutgers.edu/documents/curriculum-committee/678-sas-policies-and-procedures-on-credit-hours-and-standards-of-rigor/file">School of Arts and Sciences</a>, <a href="http://pharmacy.rutgers.edu/files/2013%20PharmD%20Curriculum%20Compliance%20Report.pdf">Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy</a>, <a href="http://oirap.rutgers.edu/disclosure_files/CreditHourDescription-SCI.pdf">School of Communication and Information</a>, <a href="http://oirap.rutgers.edu/disclosure_files/gsnb_handbook.pdf">Graduate School-New Brunswick</a> (see page 3 section 2.7), <a href="http://oirap.rutgers.edu/disclosure_files/CreditHourDescription-SEBS.pdf">School of Environmental and Biological Sciences</a>, <a href="http://oirap.rutgers.edu/disclosure_files/FASNcredithourdocumentation.pdf">Newark School of Arts and Sciences</a>, and the <a href="http://oirap.rutgers.edu/disclosure_files/CreditHourDescription-SMLR.pdf">School of Management and Labor Relations.</a></p>
